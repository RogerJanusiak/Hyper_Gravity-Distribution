Welcome to the world of Over_Gravity! After a science experiment went horribly wrong the Earth's gravity is all of a sudden much stronger. This has crippled the human race, but allowed for robots to take over. As the dominate race the robots are reaking havic on the planet and the human race. Luckily we have our hero Timpy, who is a cyborg. His failed robot enhancments allow for him to fight back against the robots, while his human half pushed him to help. Can Timpy help the human race survive and restore a normal gravity before it is too late?

Over_Gravity is a wave based dual stick side shooter where the player and enemies can only fall due to the increase in the earths gravity.
